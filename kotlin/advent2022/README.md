To run, install a Java JDK (17+), then execute `./gradlew run --args day`, where `day`
is the puzzle to run. `gradlew` should fetch and install a gradle runtime, so no other
dependencies are needed to run the application.

Note that running the solution for a particular day requires a corresponding input
file with name in the format "day00.txt" to be present in the input directory.

Run unit tests with `./gradlew test`.
