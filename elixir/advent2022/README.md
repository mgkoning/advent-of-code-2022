# Advent2022
To run, install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) with Mix and
run `mix escript.build` from the `advent2022` directory.

This will create an executable `advent2022`. Run this, supplying the day for
which to run the solution: `./advent2022 1` to run day 1.

Note that running the solution for a particular day requires a corresponding input
file with name in the format "day00.txt" to be present in the input directory.

Run unit tests with `mix test`.
